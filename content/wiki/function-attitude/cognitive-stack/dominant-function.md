description: What is a "dominant" function? What is its role relative to other functions?
---

The primary [[fundamentals/function-attitude|Function Attitude]] that a person uses for [Ego Orientation](/wiki/ego-orientation).

In [Lenore](/wiki/people-and-systems/lenore-thomson)'s view, the dominant and [secondary functions](/wiki/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function) are opposed enough to cause some internal conflict, but compatible enough that they generate synergy and intelligent adaptation and individuation pretty quickly and easily.

Some explorations of how this might work are on [Parliament of Attitudes Exegesis](/wiki/exegeses/parliament-of-attitudes), [Checks and Balances](/wiki/checks-and-balances), [Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis](/wiki/exegeses/introversion-extraversion/saints-and-politicians-exegesis) and [Place-Your-Stakes Exegesis](/wiki/exegeses/introversion-extraversion/place-your-stakes-exegesis).
