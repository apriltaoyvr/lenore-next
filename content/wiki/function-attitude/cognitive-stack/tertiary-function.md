The [Function Attitude](/wiki/fundamentals/function-attitude) opposite to a person's [Secondary Function](/wiki/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function).

For example, an ISTP has [Extraverted Sensation](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-sensing) as her secondary function and Introverted Intuition as her tertiary function. An ENFJ has Extraverted Feeling as their secondary and [Introverted Thinking](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-thinking) as their secondary.

See [Tertiary Temptation](/wiki/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/tertiary-temptation), [Tertiary Defense](/wiki/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/tertiary-defense).
