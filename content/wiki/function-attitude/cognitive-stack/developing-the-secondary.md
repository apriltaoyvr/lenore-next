Here are some ideas about the kinds of shifts in perspective that [Lenore](/wiki/people-and-systems/lenore-thomson) might be referring to when she speaks of using the [Secondary Function](/wiki/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function) to support a dominant "agenda" vs. using the [Secondary Function](/wiki/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function) to genuinely broaden your perspective.

## Examples

_Ti:_ Spinning the truth vs. Seeing the whole truth

_Fi:_ Pleasure-seeking vs. Seeing what is truly good

_Si:_ Seeking facts to support a purpose vs. Allowing yourself to see whatever facts are there

_Ni:_ Seeing through smoke and mirrors vs. Seeing the validity of other perspectives

Deconstructing an opposing view vs. using a shared vocabulary to communicate your own view

_Te:_ Judging vs. Navigating

_Fe:_ Serving vs. Negotiating

_Se:_ Idle amusement vs. Being present

_Ne:_ Idle curiosity vs. Opportunism

### Advice Columnists

> p. 84: "A good percentage of the questions (that appear in columns like Dear Abby and Ann Landers) are from people contending with what might be called a crisis of the [Secondary Function](/wiki/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function). Although these columnists don't use typological terms, they invariably persuade their correspondents to make the necessary shift in attitude.

A widow whose husband was her best and only friend (Introverted Judgement) is advised to look outside and explore new options (Extraverted Perception)."

Talk radio host Laura Schlessinger's favorite strategy with a caller is to apply an infinite regression of "So what?"'s to the feared consequences that would result from the caller taking her advice. The question "So what?" seems to strike directly at the [Dominant Function](/wiki/dominant-function), leaving it dazed and speechless, perhaps forcing a person to reverse attitudes.
