Jung wrote [_Psychological Types_](https://www.amazon.ca/Psychological-Types-Carl-Jung/dp/1138687421), a foundational work behind [Thomson](/wiki/people-and-systems/lenore-thomson)'s *Personality Type: An Owner's Manual*. One could argue he's the granddaddy of these systems ([Thomson](./lenore-thomson.md)'s, [MBTI](./myers-briggs.md), Socionics, etc.).

## Jung's Type

Hypothesis: ISTJ

As evidenced in the way he built his type system (within the confines of the book _Psychological Types_):

_Psychological Types_, Ch. 11, Definitions:

> It may perhaps seem superfluous that I should add to my text a chapter dealing solely with definitions. _But ample evidence has taught me that_, in psychological works particularly, one cannot proceed to **cautiously** in regard to the _concepts and terms_ one uses: for nowhere do such wide divergences of meaning occur as in the domain of psychology, creating only too frequently the most obstinate _misunderstandings_.

[_Lenore_](/wiki/people-and-systems/lenore-thomson)_,_ p. 188:

> They are masters of gradual, almost imperceptible modification. They tinker here, shore up there, solve problems and rectify ambiguities, all the while preserving the best of what exists, scarcely recognizing that in the process, they've adapted form quite brilliantly to function.
>
> Such types can find it difficult to limit and organize the data of their mental world without an _external reference point_ to guide them.
>
> Introverted sensation motivates ISTJs to _acquire facts and to retain them_ (memory), but it offers no way to discriminate among them rationally (see prior sentence).
>
> they can strike others as overly **cautious** and unyielding workaholics.

If he isn't an ISTJ, he's most likely an INTJ.
