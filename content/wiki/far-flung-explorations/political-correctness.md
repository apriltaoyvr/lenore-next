Hypothesis: [Lenore Thomson](/wiki/people-and-systems/lenore-thomson)'s theory explains "politically correct" speech codes and intolerance and the like as [Introverted Intuition](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition) gone wild, trying to move into the extraverted arena as a basis of social agreement—where it can't possibly work.

## Lenore on Ni and political correctness

> p. 235-6: "INJs also defend their [Intuition](/wiki/function-attitude/functions/intuition) by applying their Judgment to institutionalized bias. This is a valid concern, of course, and well developed INJs are often in the forefront of battles involving inclusive language. However, when these types are defending their inner world against inferior aims, they invariably focus on terms that suggest a Sensate viewpoint--that is, one determined by surface criteria: gender, race, color, and so forth"
>
> "The defensive nature of these efforts is apparent in the laws, charters, hymn books, and classroom agendas that issue from them. The language of these products is not inclusive so much as disembodied. Made to accomodate the INJ's purely conceptual approach to life, the terms don't support every point of view; they reflect no one's actual experience."

## Neutrality über alles

[Introverted intuition](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition) leads you to seek a point of view outside any system, from which to make judgements about that system and see aspects of the system that can't be seen on its own terms. In particular, it leads you to seek a _neutral_ perspective: one from which you can render judgements without bias, especially hidden bias.

A particular form of bias that many INJs especially loathe is the bias that comes from your economic situation: your social class, or who's buttering your bread. If you're from an economically well-off social class, it can be very convenient to believe that you and your friends are better off than the poor people across town because you're smarter, have more drive, better moral character, or some other innate trait that makes you come off looking good and _deserving_ your privileged position. There are winking conspiracies, where people play along with a social myth like "we're the most charitable," lest they be kicked out of their group and lose all the attendant benefits. These convenient myths are never put to a real test, because the unwritten social rules prevent any such test from ever occurring. Instead, there is the ever-present false test: "See, we're better off and we look nicer. If they were better people, they'd be better off, too."

[Introverted intuition](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition) used for [ego orientation](/wiki/ego-orientation) leads one to take responsibility for the unintended consequences of decisions and the hidden factors that lurk behind public façades. The felt responsibility is to ensure that all decisions take all these hidden factors into account.

### From eye-opening heuristic to guilt for being alive

Interest in hidden bias goes too far when the rule becomes, "Make no decision until the criteria for making it are certain to be without any form of bias whatsoever." This cannot be done. When raised to the level of a moral principle meant to bind a society, it simply nullifies all social agreements and offers nothing to put in their place. It turns the fact that you are a living being, eager as any living being to turn things to your advantage and flourish in the world, into a source of shame.

If you are successful in any way, using your talents and social connections as any person must in order to flourish, this is proof of your guilt. It's not enough to achieve, you are only allowed to achieve if you can prove that you did it without any special advantage that someone else did not possess. Even judging something as an achievement reflects bias: other people, raised differently, might not agree that designing semiconductors is a worthy achievement; they might instead value break dancing. Who are you to say that yours is better--or more worthy of funding? And is your valuation an unbiased reflection on what is truly worthy, or a reflection of the fact that you happen to be better at designing semiconductors than break dancing?

The extremes of political correctness come about when every public act that in some way uses or establishes power—which is to say, every public act—is viewed as something that must be put down by force lest it establish an unequal power relationship. So, for example, complimenting a woman on her appearance must be stopped, because it establishes a particular feminine role, a role that the woman might not agree to. Even if the particular woman enjoys it, this is no reason to allow the behavior: her enjoyment of being complimented might not be a truly free and informed choice. It might grow out of a lifetime of seeing that women in this role receive material benefits, and a sense that in order to get along, she must go along; the woman might not have allowed herself to ever imagine an alternative.

The philosophy of John Rawls would be the ultimate _reductio ad absurdum_ of [introverted intuition](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition) as the sole basis of social contract.

## To the anonymous complainer

I deleted your objections because they were all just saying that there's no empirical basis for the hypothesis above, rather than offering any sort of alternative idea. Also, you seemed to be saying that the hypothesis above is _wrong,_ not just an inaccurate representation of [Lenore Thomson](/wiki/people-and-systems/lenore-thomson). If you think someone's ideas have been misrepresented, do please post about it, but explain their actual ideas.

You objected, "Anything fucking goes here." That is actually almost right. Anything goes, as long as it's [exegesis](/wiki/fundamentals/exegesis) of [Lenore Thomson](/wiki/people-and-systems/lenore-thomson), not personal remarks, and not a claim that a hypothesis posted here is right or wrong. Opposing hypotheses are welcome, as are tangents that briefly summarize topics that come up, like the main ideas of John Rawls. See [How to Participate Here](/wiki/misc/how-to-participate-here-archive) for more, and please take note of "Focus more on presenting ideas than on refuting them."

I gave a fuller answer to your complaints on my user page.

## A different angle (Fe)

[Introverted intuition](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition) is what gives people the desire to detect inherent biases and to examine underlying beliefs behind behaviours. Questioning subconscious, destructive assumptions you or others around you have is Ni at its best. Developing an internal system of viewing a world that can only function within a vacuum, refuses to accept some bias, and is missing additional context is Ni at its worst. It is vulnerable to solipsism the way all introverted functions are by nature of being Introverted, thus [Subjective](/wiki/our-difficulties/terms-with-nonobvious-meanings#objective-and-subjective).

However, quick judgement without nuance on dynamics between people applies better to [Extraverted Feeling](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling). It pertains to personal ethics ([Feeling](/wiki/function-attitude/functions/feeling)), examines relationships between others and views acts as showing allegiance ([Extraverted Feeling](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling)), and is prone to lacking nuance by preferring 'simpler', broader rules (Extraverted [Judgement](/wiki/function-attitude/functions/judgement)).

Political correctness gone wrong is likely a combination of poor Ni and poor Fe. In the examples above, it is being paired with [Extraverted Feeling](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling). Poor utilisation of [Introverted Intuition](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition) (missing breadth, seeking an absolute lack of bias) and [Extraverted Feeling](/wiki/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling) (imposing ethics, assuming actions as a demonstration of imposing roles) is what lends itself to more extreme forms of political correctness.

Example: A non-native, non-fluent speaker of a language unknowingly says something offensive.

An unhealthy EFJ will be quick to think that this speaker is intending (Ni) to demonstrate they dislike xyz group (Fe) because what is said is offensive (Extraverted [Judgement](/wiki/function-attitude/functions/judgement) broad strokes). Developed Ni will allow the user to question their own perception of the speaker and understand what they want to express. Developed Fe will allow them to understand the speaker has additional barriers to accurate self-expression and what the real relational role they wish to demonstrate is.

In this process, the EFJ will have a better understanding of the circumstances that surround _this person's_ disadvantages in conversation and accomodate accordingly. Political correctness gone right.
